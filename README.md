## Description

The About Cat Breeds application is developed a dynamic web application feature that allows users to select and view detailed information about different cat breeds. The feature fetches breed data from an external API and displays the information in a user-friendly interface.

The card includes:

* Breed image
* Description
* Temperament
* Origin

Users have the flexibility to display multiple breed cards simultaneously, allowing them to compare and choose their favorites. Additionally, users can easily add and delete cards to customize their viewing experience.


## Installation

* Fork and clone repository
* Commit and push

Pull requests are welcome.
