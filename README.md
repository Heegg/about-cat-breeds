# about-cat-breeds

This single-page application (SPA) leverages the public Cat API and utilizes three main front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The About Cat Breeds application is designed to provide users with a comprehensive list of cat breeds. Users can select a specific breed from a dropdown menu, and upon selection, a card displaying an image and detailed information about the chosen breed will appear on the webpage.

The card includes:

* Breed image
* Description
* Temperament
* Lifespan 
* Origin

Users have the flexibility to display multiple breed cards simultaneously, allowing them to compare and choose their favorites. Additionally, users can easily add and delete cards to customize their viewing experience.

## Installation

* Fork and clone repository
* Commit and push

Pull requests are welcome. 
For major changes, I suggest users to open the issue first to discuss any changes you want.
Also, make sure to update tests accordingly!
